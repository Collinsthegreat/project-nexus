Movie Recommendation App â€“ Backend Project
Project Overview
About

The Movie Recommendation App is a real-world backend system designed to provide users with personalized movie recommendations powered by external APIs (e.g., TMDb). The project simulates modern streaming platforms by combining user authentication, personalized recommendations, favorites management, and data caching.

It demonstrates best practices in backend development, API design, secure authentication, and performance optimization. This project enables learners to understand how recommendation engines are integrated into scalable applications.

Team Roles

Backend Developer: Implements API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic for recommendations.

Database Administrator: Manages schema design, indexing, and query optimization.

DevOps Engineer: Deploys, monitors, and scales backend services.

QA Engineer: Tests API endpoints, validation rules, and ensures quality standards.

Project Goals

User Management: Secure registration, authentication, and profile handling.

Movie Discovery: Fetch trending and recommended movies from TMDb API.

Personalized Recommendations: Provide suggestions based on user history and preferences.

Favorites Management: Enable users to add/remove movies to a personal favorites list.

System Optimization: Use caching and indexing for performance.

Admin Tools (Optional): Manage users and monitor API usage.

Technology Stack

Django / Django REST Framework: Backend and API development.

PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing users and favorites.

Redis / Caching Layer: Improves performance by reducing redundant API calls.

Celery (Future Scope): For asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications.

TMDb API Integration: External service for fetching real-time movie data.

Database Design
Key Entities and Fields

Users

user_id (Primary Key)

username

email

password_hash

Favorites

favorite_id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key â†’ Users.user_id)

movie_id

movie_title

poster_url

Recommendations (Cache / Logs)

recommendation_id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key â†’ Users.user_id)

Entity Relationships

A User can have multiple Favorites (one-to-many).

A User can receive multiple Recommendations (one-to-many).

Feature Breakdown
1. User Management

Register, log in, and manage profiles securely.

JWT authentication ensures secure session handling.

2. Movie Discovery

Fetch trending movies from TMDb API.

Expose endpoints for browsing and searching movies.

3. Personalized Recommendations

Generate user-specific recommendations based on activity.

Cache recommendations for faster retrieval.

4. Favorites Management

Add or remove movies from a userâ€™s favorites list.

Retrieve favorite movies for personalization.

5. Data Optimization

Use Redis or similar caching to minimize redundant API calls.

Apply indexing for quick retrieval of user favorites and history.

6. Admin Tools (Future Scope)

Manage users and system logs.

Monitor TMDb API usage and performance.

Features Overview

API Documentation

OpenAPI Standard: Clear API documentation for easy integration.

Django REST Framework: Handles CRUD operations on users and favorites.

User Authentication

Endpoints: /auth/register, /auth/login

Features: Secure user creation, login, and token-based session management.

Movie Discovery

Endpoints: /movies/trending, /movies/search

Features: Retrieve trending and searched movies via TMDb API.

Recommendations

Endpoints: /movies/recommendations

Features: Fetch personalized movie recommendations for logged-in users.

Favorites Management

Endpoints: /favorites/, /favorites/{movie_id}

Features: Add/remove and view favorite movies.

Database Optimizations

Indexing: Optimize queries on user_id and movie_id.

Caching: Store trending movies for 15 minutes to reduce API load.

API Security
Authentication

JWT-based authentication for all protected routes.

Authorization

Role-based access control (User vs Admin).

Rate Limiting

Restrict external API requests and user calls to avoid abuse.

Input Validation & Sanitization

Validate emails, passwords, and IDs to prevent SQL injection and XSS.

HTTPS Enforcement

Encrypt all client-server communications.

CI/CD Pipeline

What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration and Deployment automate testing, building, and deploying changes.

Why Itâ€™s Important:

Faster releases and bug detection.

Higher consistency across environments.

Automated testing ensures quality.

Tools Used:

GitHub Actions: Automates tests, linting, and deployments.

Docker: Containerized environments for consistent builds.

Heroku / AWS / Vercel: Platforms for hosting backend services.

PostgreSQL / Redis: Integrated into test pipelines for real-world data validation.

Why Security is Crucial

User Data: Protects private information like email and passwords.

Favorites & History: Prevents misuse of personal preferences.

External API Calls: Prevents abuse and ensures compliance with TMDb API terms.
